 * Following definition aliases fopen to fopen64 on above mentioned
 * platforms. This makes it possible to open and sequentially access files
 * larger than 2GB from 32-bit application. It does not allow to traverse
 * them beyond 2GB with fseek/ftell, but on the other hand *no* 32-bit
 * platform permits that, not with fseek/ftell. Not to mention that breaking
 * 2GB limit for seeking would require surgery to *our* API. But sequential
 * access suffices for practical cases when you can run into large files,
 * such as fingerprinting, so we can let API alone. For reference, the list
 * of 32-bit platforms which allow for sequential access of large files
 * without extra "magic" comprise *BSD, Darwin, IRIX...
